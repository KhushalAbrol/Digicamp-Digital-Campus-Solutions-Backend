IIITB SPE Final Academic Project

DigiCamp  - “Digital Campus Solutions”

Motivation:
Problem 1:
Hundreds of delivery/couriers/packages arrive on campus every day which are first received at the security gates. Currently the security guard has to manually make an entry into its notebook registers of each delivery/courier/packages and when students get time they visit the reception and collect their packages after signing their entries. In this process , we have observed that there is wastage of paper and time. Also there is no guarantee that the person who is receiving the order is the right person as current process does not ensure authenticity of identity as anyone can take anyone’s package by spoofing signature because there is no proper audit maintained of who received the order to track if someone intentionally/unintentionally collects incorrect package


Problem 2:	
Another problem is tracking lost and found items on campus. As of now there is no proper provision of lost items management inside campus.

Solution Description: 
This app has two modules:
Delivered package Management:
This platform will help in managing the delivered packages in campus, it will eliminate the paper wastage as everything will be managed digitally. This module will list all the packages which can be searched using the search option by name or mobile number. The portal will be open to each student for viewing only and checkout can only be done using authorized user(guard) where the system will automatically capture an image using a webcam of the person who is receiving the order. This will help in tracking if a package gets delivered to an incorrect person maintaining authenticity and identity.
  Lost and Found Management:
This module will enable the user to click a photo of the found item or in case of lost item there will be a text box to write info like location and description of item.
The lost/found items will be listed on the web page category wise which the owner can easily search and can collect from the given location. System will capture an image of the user collecting the item before marking the record as “Given”  to maintain authenticity and this record will be stored as a history.
